# sports-live-gfx
Sports live-casting graphics for use with [Open Broadcaster Software](https://obsproject.com/) and NodeCG

# ~~How To Use~~
1. ~~Place [Scoreboard Assistant ](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/scoreboard-assistant.112/) (Non-Free) and all associated files in the sports-live-gfx folder.~~
2. ~~Add **lowerthirdsports.html** to OBS via the [Browser Plugin](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/browser-plugin.115/)~~
3. ~~Manipulate Scores and names with Scoreboard Assistant and see magic~~

# ~~TODO~~
- ~~Remove dependence on non-free Scoreboard Assistant~~
- ~~Implement better clock backend. Perferably one that doesn't write to disk every second.~~
- ~~Clean up CSS~~
- ~~Learn / Optimize JS~~

# ~~Notes~~
- ~~XSS is disabled in Chrome by deafult. Either use Mozilla FireFox or the Browser Plugin for OBS to change scores.~~
- ~~This is my first attempt at JS, CSS and HTML. I apologize in advance for spaghetti code.~~
